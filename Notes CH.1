CODE - or source code;  a set of commands for a computer to execute
Statement -  a group of letters or words and operators to perform a task
    a (letter / variable) = (operator) b (letter/variable) + (operator) 2 (literal value)
    Programs are a collection of statements
Expresion - The different parts of a expression
    a = b * 2
      2 = literal expression
      b = variable expression
      b * 2 = arithmatic expression
      a = b * 2 = assignment variable
Operators - How we perform actions on variable and values
      -Assignment ( a = 2; )
      -Math ( +, - , * , /) ( a + 1 = b)
      -Compound ( += , -= , *= , /=) (a+=1 (a = a + 1) are the same thing)
      -Increment/Decrement ( ++, --) a++(a = a+1)
      -Object property access (console.log() )
      -Equality ==(loose-equals) ===(strict equals) !=(loose not equals) 
      -Comparisonm <,>,<=,>=
      -Logical &&(and) || (or)
Values & Types
      -Primitive types
        -When you need to do math, you need a number
        -When you want to print a value on the sceen, you need a string
        -When you need a decision in a program , you need a boolean
       -Coersion (when you need to combine types i.e printing a number on the screen)
         -Number() function makes "99" 99 (explicit coersion)
         -"99.99" == 99.99 makes the two equivilent (implicit coersion)
Comments
      // = single line comment
      /* -- */ = multi line comment
Variables
      -a container that holds a value, so the value can change over time
      -variables can hold any type (unlike JAVA(
      -var is how you declare a variable
Blocks
      -Lines of code seperated by {}
      -Typically used with if statements
Conditionals
      -If statements (seem to be the same as Java)
Loops
      -Loop statements ( again bear a strinking resembelence to (java)
Functions
      -Breaks down a program into reusable pieces
      -can be called by name
      -they can take parameters you pass in and return a value back
